# Credit Card Fraud Detection – EDA

This repository contains an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a
credit card transaction dataset with a focus on fraud detection.

## Project Overview
The project includes data quality assessment, data cleaning, outlier
handling, class imbalance treatment, and detailed exploratory analysis to
identify fraud-related patterns.

## Key Steps
- Missing value and duplicate removal
- Outlier handling using quantile-based capping
- Class imbalance correction using random undersampling
- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- Insight generation and visualization

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Outcome
The cleaned and balanced dataset is suitable for feature engineering and
machine learning model development for fraud detection.
